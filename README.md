### Hello I'm Xander Chin

Iâ€™m an engineering student passionate about building things and sharing them on the internet!

I love experimenting and integrating hardware, software, and design with aspects of mathematics and science in the form of projects that I can showcase.

Check out my YouTube channel to see some cool projects!
